# Bomberman Gamepad Support

Just a quick hack to add Gamepad support to the new Bombermine/Bomberman game at: [http://bombermine.com](http://bombermine.com)


# Usage
Open the [bookmarklet.js file](bookmarklet.js) and copy it's contents to a new bookmark. When playing bombermine, click on it.

I used a Sixaxis controller from Sony/PS3, should work with XBox controller too though.

## Controls

Move                 -> left joystick
Drop Bomb            -> cross
Zoom out             -> circle
Pause                -> triangle
Detonate Radio Bombs -> square
Show stats           -> select
